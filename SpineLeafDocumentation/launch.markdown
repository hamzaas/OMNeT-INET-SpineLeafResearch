# Launching

***

1. Launching OMNet++ GUI is pretty simple. Open up the mingwenv commad line prompt. It will be located in the sub-root directory of the omnetpp-5.6.2-src-windows folder. I would just make a shortcut and put this on the desktop.

2. Once the command line opens. Simply type 'omnetpp' and hit enter. You will be spending 90% of your time in the GUI. The GUI is where you will be making, building, testing, and implementing your projects. The command line is used more when you are running your simulation for long periods of time to gather results.
