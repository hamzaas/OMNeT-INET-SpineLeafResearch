# **Introduction**

***



OMNeT-INET-SpineLeafResearch is a simulation of a spine-leaf data center network
implemented in [OMNeT++](https://omnetpp.org/) and [INET](https://inet.omnetpp.org/).
This simulation allows for the data center to be
scalable and customizable. Our custom traffic generator also allows for different
sized traffic even on different sized networks. This project is intended for
research purposes. It was developed as a research project by two research assistants,
 Bryan Hill and Ethan Little, under
 Dr. Baset Hamza at [Appalachian State University](https://compsci.appstate.edu/).

### **About this Wiki**
<br/>

This website is intended to be a comprehensive guide for installing, running,
and obtaining results from the simulation. In addition, we hope to provide an
in-depth overview for the code, design, and flow for all parts of the simulation.
