# The .ned File

***

The NED file is also a critical file to your network simulation as it describes your network topology. With OMNeT alone building network topologies can be difficult. That is why we use INET++. INET is an extension to OMNeT++ and allows us to drag and drop routers, servers, switches, radios, ethernet cables, and like a 1,000 different things. Now back to the NED file. The NED file has two tabs. You can build and edit using either tab.

***

1. The Design tab. Shows you the actual look of your network.

2. The Source tab. Shows you the code to the network. Inside the source tab you can see the network class. That name goes into your .ini file.
