# Running the Simulation

***

Running the simulation can be done in two different ways. First, the OMNeT++
IDE offers a way to run projects with a GUI that shows network construction
and the flow of data (packets). Second, we have developed a bash scripts that
can also run the simulation (with no GUI) as well as run several python scripts.
