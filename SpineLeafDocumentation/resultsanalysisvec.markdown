# ResultsAnalysisVec.py

***

 - `ResultsAnalysisVec.py`: This script takes the `size_freq.txt` file generated by `SendScript.py` as input
and produces a bar graph showing size of traffic and frequency. The purpose of this graph is to show that our
traffic generator produces traffic that is similar to that of a real datacenter. Real datacenter traffic frequency
is hard to come by, but we were able to obtain a reference graph from a [research paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1851182.1851192).

- The script utilizes the Python packages `pandas` and `plotly.express` to accomplish two tasks.

1. `pandas` is used to create a data frame from the `size_freq.txt` file that isolates the
`Size(Bytes)`, and `Frequency` fields and drops empty rows.

2. `plotly.express` is used to generate a bar graph of this cleaned data frame.

An example of a generated graph can be seen blow.

The code that does this can be seen below.

```python
import pandas as panda
import plotly.express as px

results = panda.read_csv('size_freq.txt')

# Creating new data frame
spines = results[['Size(Bytes)', 'Frequency']].dropna()

# Displaying bar graph
fig = px.bar(spines, x='Size(Bytes)', y='Frequency')
fig.write_html('size_graph.html', auto_open=True)
```
