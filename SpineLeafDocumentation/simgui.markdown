# The Simulation GUI

***

When you run you simulation the simulation GUI will pop up. In here you can visualy watch your netork simulation run. Which is really nice for testing and debugging but can be very slow when trying to run your simulation for a long period of time to gather results.

***

1. The first thing you will notics is the simulation time and tools. The time at the top right is simulation time. The tools to the left of it just simply change the real-time speed.

2. The second thing you should focus on is the green background portion of the GUI. This is where the actual simulation visualization takes place.

3. The last thing is the console at the bottom. Can be very useful for debug purposes. More information about the simulation can be found here: [OMNeT++ simulation GUI #Chapter 7.1](https://doc.omnetpp.org/omnetpp/UserGuide.pdf).
